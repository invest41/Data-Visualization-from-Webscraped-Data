# Data-Visualization-from-Webscraped-Data

Project description

Tools: Python and its Libraries, SQL programming, Microsoft Excel, JavaScript, and HTML

Useful Applicatons: 
1) MOST SEARCHED WORDS in Identifying new SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) KEYWORDS to target for your products visibility  
2) MOST REFERENCED WORDS on a companyâ€™s official release and public response to analyse their most popular products  
3) Product Sentiment Analysis  
4) For Analyzing business customer and employee feedback  
5) Also useful for Copyrighters and Fiction Writers   

Steps of creation: 
- I designed python packages for my tools and wrote extensive Python Algorithms into my source files 
- I wrote source files for Customized Web scraping, Data Cleaning and Filtering
- I automated data formatting for my data sets into CSV and JSON file, into my Database and loading on Excel Spreadsheets 
- I retrieved sample Data, then visualised the Data Sets using JavaScript (D3 library), and HTML as well as python Libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Wordcloud)

Process of use:
- Run  "Webscraping_Tool" script and provide destination URL as input
- Output file is "rough_work" text file
- Run "Make_Translation" script to auto-clean data, Output file "clean_work" text and csv file
- Run "Load_on_database" or "load_on_excel" sripts to load on appropriate end destination for storage
- Run "WordCloud_python" script to make WordCloud out of the "clean_work" CSV content
- Run "WordCloud_javascript" script to make JavaScript file (gword.js) out of the "clean_work" text content
- Run the "gword.htm" file to visualise "gword.js". 
Note: Make sure "d3.layout.cloud.js" and "d3.v2.js" files as well as "gword.htm" and "gword.js" files are in the same folder
